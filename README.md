This is my Guessing Game C Project transformed into MIPS Assembly. This has the same function as the Guessing Game C Project however we were required to transform our C code into
MIPS Assembly code and have it function just as it does in C. So, this is a program that generates 3 random integers from 1 - 9. After generating the random numbers it asks the user to enter 3 integers from 1 - 9. It then tells you if or which integers you have in the right spot. If you have a number in the correct position it gives you a strike however if you have a number in the wrong position it will give you a ball. If the numbers you entered isn't one of their random integers then you will get a 0 for that integer. If you guess correctly all 3 integers and their position it will then ask if you want to play again or quit.
